        <h2>My Future</h2>

         <h3>Highschool</h3>
            <p>I hope I get into Lakewood because I feel like I could really benefit from the HOSM
             (health occupations and sport medicine) program. Also, I want to try and be on their 
             soccer team. </p>

        <h3>College</h3>
            <p>First, I want to go to LBSC just to start off. When I finish with that, I want to go to UCLA,
            UC San Diego, or Stanford to be in the medical field. First, I want to go to LBSC just to start off.

        <h3> Career Interests</h3>
            <p>When I grow up, I want to be a registered nurse at Memorial Care. If I am not able to do that then I 
                would be willing to be a vet or a dancer/ singer, a professional soccer player, or an astrophotograhper.
                 Also, I would want to join the US Army just like my dad did.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>My goals in life is to achieve every obstacle that comes at me and to always do my best. I want too get better
             at math and history too.</p>
