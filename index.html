        <h2>All About Me</h2>

         <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>Some of the skills I have is being good at ela and sometimes science.
            I enjoy reading interesting stories sometimes. I am also skilled at helping people out and being 
            there for them. I know what to do during emergencies and I know how to react.
            I am also good at many sports, such as soccer, football, softball, and volleyball. 
            But I stuggle at math a lot, which is a bad thing.</p>
        
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, watching netflix, and hanging with 
            friends and family. I play soccer with Fc Priemer, and I practice every tuesday and thursday and always have games 
            on the weekends. Playing soccer and going to school is usually the only things
            I am able to do during the weekdays. </p>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I am interested in stars/galaxies and also helping others.
            I am interested in stars and the earth because it is amazing how it was all put together.
            I am interested in helping others because it makes me feel good inside and it also helps 
            other people when they need help. </p>

        <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>I have an amazing family. My mom is Salvadoran and was boring in El Salvador.
            She came to America when she was very young. My dad was born in Massachusetts but he is a Mexican. 
            They were married in 1999 and had my sister Katelyn on Otcober 15,2001. Then they had me on December 3, 2003.
